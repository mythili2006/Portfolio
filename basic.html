            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <pre>I am Mythili, a second-year BE Computer Science and Engineering student at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering. With a passion for 
                technology and innovation, I have been actively developing my technical and interpersonal skills to 
                prepare for a career in the IT industry.I have attended workshops such as the machine learning workshop at CIT, Coimbatore, 
                and participated in events like Codeconflux at PSG, which have enhanced my problem-solving and analytical thinking abilities. 
                Additionally, I have completed an internship in web development with Octanet, where I gained hands-on experience 
                in designing user-friendly web applications and understanding industry practices.Apart from academics, 
                I am eager to explore new opportunities to broaden my learning horizon and contribute meaningfully to projects and initiatives. </pre>
